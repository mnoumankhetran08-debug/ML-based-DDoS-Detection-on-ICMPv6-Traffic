# ML-based-DDoS-Detection-on-ICMPv6-Traffic
A Machine Learning-based DDoS detection system on ICMPv6 traffic analyzes network packets to identify abnormal patterns and mitigate potential flooding attacks. By training ML models on labeled datasets, it distinguishes between legitimate and malicious traffic, enhancing IPv6 network security and resilience.
